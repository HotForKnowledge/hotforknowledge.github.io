      <title>Migrating to Hugo Engine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have migrated my &lt;a href=&#34;http://old.hotforknowledge.com/&#34;&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; Wordpress blog to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Since I am not a web publishing expert,
I have nothing to say other than the experience was very nice and flexibility is awesome.
Markdown + VS Code + git rule them all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough patience to setup Jekyll with all its dependencies hell a while ago.
Wordpress was easy to install from WebMatrix and to run on IIS, but I was afraid to touch anything
because the entire setup looked fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo is super fast and doesn&amp;rsquo;t interfere with writing workflow, gives total control and a hope that I
could publish all the overdue posts about Spreads and related things soon.&lt;/p&gt;
