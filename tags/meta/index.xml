      <description>I have migrated my WordPress blog to Hugo. Since I am not a web publishing expert, I have nothing to say other than the experience was very nice and flexibility is awesome. Markdown + VS Code + git rule them all!
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough patience to setup Jekyll with all its dependencies hell a while ago. WordPress was easy to install from WebMatrix and to run on IIS in AWS cloud, but I was afraid to touch anything because the entire setup looked fragile.</description>

      <description>On my LinkedIn page, there are almost no endorsements for programming/tech, even though I program since age 12 or so. Probably this is an indication that the endorsement system is broken there or I am not very active there recently. Or this is a reflection of a mild problem I have - very few people from my former professional, mostly investment banking, network know that I can code well beyond VBA scripts.</description>
