    <p>On my LinkedIn page, there are almost no endorsements for programming/tech, even though 
I program since age 12 or so. Probably this is an indication that the endorsement system 
is broken there or I am not very active there recently. Or this is a reflection of a mild
problem I have - very few people from my former professional,
mostly investment banking, network know that I can code well beyond VBA scripts. 
The problem is mild because I am not interested in a full-time programmer job outside finance or data science domain.
I am mostly interested in quantitative finance or startup projects where I could utilize all my knowledge 
and boost my productivity by delegating work to hardware. These days I think about programming in the same
way as I think about math or English language or Excel - it is just an essential tool for achieving goals
in some practical domain, not a separate domain (unless you are a language designer or a computer science teacher).</p>
<p>I enjoy many aspects of pure programming, such as <del>premature</del> performance  optimization, but the most exciting thing about programming for me is an augmentation of my human abilities. I cannot add numbers hundred million times per second or crawl the entire web and analyze the content of million pages, but I can write a program to do so. A great philosophical question, which requires a separate post, is &ldquo;Who is the actor - an entity that performs the actions encoded in my program - when my program runs&rdquo;. Is it a machine, or a person who started the program, or an author of programming language, or a CPU designer, or it is me? Isn&rsquo;t it a way to expand human consciousness and existence beyond their bodies and lifetimes!?</p>
<p>Below are my answers to some programming background questions from my application to the Hacker School, where I spent three summer months in 2014 and which is now known as the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>. (I like the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/77-hacker-school-is-now-the-recurse-center">old name</a> much more!)  By the way, this is a great place for people who are passionate about programming, who are not yet damaged by formal education or <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">enterprise software practices</a>, and who prefer <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/02/zuck-letter/">the hacker way</a> of doing things to other ways.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your programming background in a few sentences.</strong></p>
<p>At age 12, I was yet to learn about the Turing test and tried to write a chatbot talking to humans. That failure did not push me away from programming. During my high school, I was planning for a CS degree and was accepted to a local tech university already in January 2002. However, in the June the best university in my country invited me to any economics faculty I would choose, without exams. That was a no-brainer because I liked economics as well. Programming became my main hobby and an important tool for study and work, but it was not my craft. In 2010, I was not happy with the stagnating investments industry and could not ignore the booming tech industry, so I started to invest my time heavily into modern programming. I was fluent in VBA and OK with the LAMP stack and HTML/JavaScript, so I started with Ruby on Rails. Then I touched statically typed C# and realized that I cannot stand for the avoidable complexity of dynamic languages. With C#, I started to develop some projects, but it did not work for some tasks. Over the past year, I learned F# to a decent level and now I develop my grown-up projects with .NET stack with a huge bias toward F#.</p>
<p><strong>Have you worked professionally as a programmer?</strong></p>
<p>No, technically. But my first ever $100 I earned around 2004 from guys in my dorm by writing a search web page to query a DB with real estate objects and a page with a form to add new objects. Then a colleague from my first real job for several months paid me an additional half of my intern salary from his pocket to develop for him a website about the local stock market. Then I used VBA/SQL heavily to build infrastructure for analytics and to do complex calculations while working at other banks; however, I was paid for investment research, not code. Now I program my own projects and this is my primary activity, but it is not employment.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?</strong></p>
<p>I do not have a CS degree and am not going to seek one because this is impractical now.</p>
<p>(answers are as of January 2014)</p>
