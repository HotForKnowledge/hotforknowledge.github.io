      <title>How to write the simplest trading strategy using Spreads</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am always amused when retail traders are offered and then do use black boxes with complex frameworks to build automatic trading strategies. Usually that goes with an explanation how cool those platforms are and how easy to build a strategy using them. They forget about vendor lock-in and the most terrible model of &lt;em&gt;shared state with events hell&lt;/em&gt; like &amp;ldquo;OnData&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;OnOrder&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;OnBarOpen&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;OnBarClose&amp;rdquo;, etc. The more I talk with people, the more I realize that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing&#34;&gt;CEP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the approach that desks and serious traders use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreads is not a framework for financial markets but a generic CEP library that allows to model markets as &lt;em&gt;data series&lt;/em&gt; and use pure math and functional data transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest trivial example is &lt;em&gt;simple moving average &lt;/em&gt;trend following strategy. This example is written in F# interactive console.  First, we generate trending artificial data where trend changes each 40 points:
&lt;pre class=&#34;lang:default decode:true&#34;&gt;let quotes : Series&amp;lt;DateTime, float&amp;gt; = // data is produced outside
    let mutable previous = 1.0
    let sm = SortedMap()
    let now = DateTime.UtcNow
    let mutable trend = -1.0
    let mutable cnt = 0
    for i in 0..500 do
      previous &amp;lt;- previous*(1.0 + rng.NextDouble()*0.002 - 0.001 + 0.001 * trend)
      sm.Add(now.AddSeconds(-((500-i) |&amp;gt; float)*0.2), previous)
      cnt &amp;lt;- cnt + 1
      if cnt % 40 = 0 then trend &amp;lt;- -trend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Task.Run((fun _ -&amp;amp;gt;

    while not ct.IsCancellationRequested do
      Thread.Sleep(500)
      previous &amp;amp;lt;- previous*(1.0 + rng.NextDouble()*0.002 - 0.001 + 0.001 * trend)
      sm.Add(DateTime.UtcNow, previous)
      cnt &amp;amp;lt;- cnt + 1
      if cnt % 40 = 0 then trend &amp;amp;lt;- -trend
  ), ct) |&amp;amp;gt; ignore
sm :&amp;amp;gt; Series&amp;amp;lt;DateTime, float&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we calculate simple moving average over 20 points. The second argument allows using incomplete windows, e.g. for the first 10 data points the average is calculated over them. With false, the first SMA point is calculated only at the 20th quotes point.
&lt;pre class=&#34;lang:default decode:true &#34;&gt;let sma = quotes.SMA(20, true)&lt;/pre&gt;
Our trading rule is that if the current price is above SMA, we go long, and we go short otherwise. This is a classic trend following strategy and it works quite well in the long run on emerging markets and some commodities. We calculate our target position as:
&lt;pre class=&#34;lang:default decode:true&#34;&gt;let targetPosition = (quotes / sma - 1.0).Map(fun deviation -&amp;gt; double &amp;lt;| Math.Sign(deviation))
&lt;/pre&gt;
This target position series is live - its values are updated in real-time together with quotes. To execute our strategy, we must prepare storage for actual positions and trades:
&lt;pre class=&#34;lang:default decode:true &#34;&gt;// we must keep track of actual position
let actualPositionWritable = SortedMap&amp;lt;DateTime,float&amp;gt;()
let realTrades = SortedMap&amp;lt;DateTime,float&amp;gt;()
let actualPosition = actualPositionWritable :&amp;gt; Series&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;
actualPosition.Do((fun k v -&amp;gt;
    Console.WriteLine(&amp;ldquo;Actual position: &amp;ldquo; + k.ToString() + &amp;rdquo; : &amp;ldquo; + v.ToString())
  ), ct)&lt;/pre&gt;
Then we could feed our target position to a trader. Trader is &amp;ldquo;functional&amp;rdquo;, instead of receiving orders it receives desired state and does its best to move actual state to the desired state. Here for simplicity we have a very dangerous assumption that trades are executed  immediately after a signal. Such an assumption should be avoided in real world backtesting. &lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5;&#34;&gt;We use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=&#34;line-height: 1.5;&#34;&gt;Do()&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5;&#34;&gt; extension method that invokes an action over each key/value in a series sequentially:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;lang:default decode:true &#34;&gt;targetPosition.Do(
  (fun k v -&amp;gt;
    if k &amp;lt;= DateTime.UtcNow.AddMilliseconds(-400.0) then
      // simulate historical trading
      let qty =
        if actualPositionWritable.IsEmpty then v
        else (v - actualPositionWritable.Last.Value)
      if qty &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0.0 then
        Console.WriteLine(k.ToString() +  &amp;ldquo; : Paper trade: &amp;ldquo; + qty.ToString())
        actualPositionWritable.AddLast(k, v)
    else
      // do real trading
      let qty =
        if actualPositionWritable.IsEmpty then failwith &amp;ldquo;must test strategy before real trading&amp;rdquo;
        else (v - actualPositionWritable.Last.Value)
      if qty &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0.0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; k &amp;gt; actualPositionWritable.Last.Key then // protect from executing history
        let tradeTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMilliseconds(5.0)
        Console.WriteLine(tradeTime.ToString() +  &amp;ldquo; : Real trade: &amp;ldquo; + qty.ToString())
        realTrades.AddLast(tradeTime, qty)
        actualPositionWritable.AddLast(tradeTime, v)
  ), ct)&lt;/pre&gt;
Now the trading is started and we could see our trades in the FSI console every several seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we calculate our P&amp;amp;L. Because the market was trending by construction, we have earned a lot of money with this strategy:
&lt;pre class=&#34;lang:default decode:true&#34;&gt;let returns = quotes.ZipLag(1u, fun c p -&amp;gt; c/p - 1.0)
let myReturns = actualPosition.Repeat() * returns
let myAumIndex = myReturns.Scan(1.0, fun st k v -&amp;gt; st*(1.0 + v))&lt;/pre&gt;
Here, we use &lt;em&gt;ZipLag()&lt;/em&gt; to calculate price returns. Then we calculate returns of our position and aggregate them as running product (no trading costs in this example). All these and above series are live, we could use the &lt;em&gt;Do()&lt;/em&gt; method to print the values in real-time:
&lt;pre class=&#34;lang:default decode:true &#34;&gt;// Print live data
myAumIndex.Do((fun k v -&amp;gt;
    Console.WriteLine(&amp;ldquo;AUM Index: &amp;ldquo; + k.ToString() + &amp;rdquo; : &amp;ldquo; + v.ToString())
  ), ct)&lt;/pre&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that from the technical point of view there is nothing special that links the calculations to financial markets. Instead of financial data, we could use data from some sensors, e.g. temperature, and instead of trading we could turn off/on heating if temperature goes above or below some target value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole example is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Spreads/Spreads/blob/master/tests/Spreads.Tests.Profile/Example.fsx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You could select all code, press Alt+Enter and watch how AUM increases while using Spreads library! :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Spreads library</title>
      <link>http://hotforknowledge.com/2015/12/20/introducing-spreads-library/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2015 17:46:36 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://hotforknowledge.com/2015/12/20/introducing-spreads-library/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR;&lt;/strong&gt; This post is about background and thoughts on my number-crunching library &lt;strong&gt;Spreads, &lt;/strong&gt;which stands for  &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;eries and &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;anels for &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eal-time and &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;xploratory &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nalysis of &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;ata &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;treams. The library and its readme are on GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Spreads/Spreads&#34;&gt;https://github.com/Spreads/Spreads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- This is to make sure your relative image links show up nicely. --&gt; While I worked at Goldman Sachs as research analyst, I got used to internal declarative time series processing langauge. It was so cool that I could build MSCI index rebalancing methodology with several lines of code. Probably that was &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/147434/inside-goldman-sachs-secret-sauce/&#34;&gt;Slang&lt;/a&gt; or some wrapper around it. After I left the firm, I cannot stand for other existing tools and wanted the same functionality as an end user. I had been far away from the IT department, had no idea about implementation, never uploaded any code to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer&#34;&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; or any other file hostings and wrote my own implementation. (This paragraph is name dropping for search engines, there is no affiliation or any other relation other than design inspiration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data series could be modeled as IEnumerable or IObservable sequences. Existing libraries such as LINQ and Rx provided rich functionality and I used them initially from code. However, most data series, e.g. time series, are navigable sequences of key-value mappings. This nature could not be fully leveraged by those libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BlueMountainCapital/Deedle&#34;&gt;Deedle&lt;/a&gt; library was open sourced. I learned F# with it and contributed a couple of pull requests to it. And in a weird chain of events I almost achieved but then ruined my American dream indirectly due to my experience with Deedle. At my current work, we used it for rapid development. However, due to internal complexity, immutable design, performance and memory consumption we coundn&amp;rsquo;t continue our development with it. When we moved from a prototype on small data to a high-volume time series, Windows/Chunks caused OutOfMemory exception because of eager intermediate evaluation of each window/chunk. Windowing was one of the most frequently used functionality and we quickly realized that to avoid allocations we need lazy windows and other lazy LINQ-like calculations that leverage data series nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a year before that, I had been working on a Spreads library for complex event processing, but could not get the design and performance right. Then I re-watched videos by Rich Hickey (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values&#34;&gt;Value of values&lt;/a&gt;, especially about place oriented programming), Erik Meijer (&lt;a href=&#34;https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Keynote-Duality&#34;&gt;Duality and the End of reactive&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-From-First-Principles&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; with poor little mutable bear that was publicly torn apart) and finalized the design in my head. Series are mutable properties of some identities, e.g. a price of a financial instrument, temperature in San-Francisco, etc. Identity as a whole is immutable as an object reference (e.g. person name) until its death (a security is delisted, earth is destroyed). Series are mutable as an object, but is immutable as data. Every key-value pair inside series - when they are properties of identities - are immutable, and new pairs are appended at the end of series. In the real world, however, we could have observation errors, or even trades on exchanges could be cancelled,  so mutability is inevitable, as Erik showed with the bear, and even historical data is mutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the core functionality of Spreads was ready, we did performance tests and found that Spreads implementation was pretty fast with low memory consumption and allocations. Additionaly, Spreads library was initially designed to support real-time streaming data, but Deedle &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BlueMountainCapital/Deedle/issues/51&#34;&gt;does not and will not&lt;/a&gt; support streaming data due to fundametal design decisions (immutability, Pandas/R-like data structures). We migrated to Spreads for backtesting and optimization, implemented live streaming of data and built our entire data processing pipeline on Spreads - from strategy backtesting to trading. As of version 0.1+, existing functionality became fast and stable enough for use in our production (where we also test, debug and fix it - current status is alpha).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While developing Spreads, I became a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.ru/&#34;&gt;mechanical sympathy&lt;/a&gt;. I watched all talks by Matrin Thompson and was highly impressed (the best talk by Martin and Todd Montgomery is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxjT7veKi9c&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, listening it again while writing this post, 33:50+ is my favorite place and 100% to the point). The main data structure in Spreads - SortedMap + its cursors - was already a kind of Disruptor, and I was definitely thinking about it while developing Spreads. But Martin opened my eyes on the fact that &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/buybackoff/status/653960102374940672&#34;&gt;Fast systems are all alike; every slow system is slow in its own way&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  All his talks combined finally helped me to stop worrying about functional fundamentalism and start loving performance above any purism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/java-evolution-performance&#34;&gt;talk &lt;/a&gt;helped me to realize how happy I am using .NET, where value types in arrays are contiguous in memory, unsafe is built-in and won&amp;rsquo;t be removed in a next version, native calls do not require special builds with special method names, tooling is great, TPL is awesome, and F# is the best language in the world even for imperative programming! I have never bought the argument that MSFT is evil and Linux is religiously better. All these cries, when they sound like religious, are from cheapskates who could not afford MSFT&amp;rsquo;s product in school - but if a product is better than others and has support, it must cost money. I have Windows on MacBook, because it is better for end users who do anything else than web-browsing (e.g. Excel). I do know that Windows Server is (or used to be) not real-time in the strict sense, but nowadays FPGAs are being commoditized. Strict real-time is required for cases where lives depend on it or for &amp;ldquo;true HFT&amp;rdquo;, and such cases will always require a custom code (hopefully in Rust in the future) inside custom hardware. Since milliseconds &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/22082528/801189&#34;&gt;are no longer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;true HFT&amp;rdquo;, we could rule out this use case for managed languages. For all other cases, Spreads is fast enough (could process tens of millions of data items per second per thread) and will be even faster. (My personal challenge is to make it no slower than existing commercial systems!) I am happy to pay more to AWS or run a Windows server in office just because it is so easy to connect via RDP, and I am lazy and prefer GUI over console. But at the time I write this, some smart people &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/releases&#34;&gt;are working&lt;/a&gt; on making .NET a first-class citizen on Linux, and it is already present there via Mono. Poor JVM users do not have async/await and the goodies I mentioned in the beginning of this rant, but this is not the reason to suffer and rewrite a copy of Spreads for JVM (however, this will very likely happen). Spreads is as cross-platform as .NET, and its current developments promise a bright future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to make Spreads as mechanically sympathetic and fast as possible, at the same time keeping nice simple public API. Today I have released  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Spreads/Spreads&#34;&gt;Spreads library.&lt;/a&gt; The name &lt;strong&gt;Spreads&lt;/strong&gt; stands for &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;eries and &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;anels for &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eal-time and &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;xploratory &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nalysis of &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;ata &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;treams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not copy the readme here, please go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Spreads/Spreads&#34;&gt;Spreads repository&lt;/a&gt;, download code or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spreads/&#34;&gt;NuGet package&lt;/a&gt;, create an issue and please submit a pull request if you can. Everything is up for grabs!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My “hacker” background</title>
      <link>http://hotforknowledge.com/2015/08/23/hacker-background/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2015 17:41:56 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://hotforknowledge.com/2015/08/23/hacker-background/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my LinkedIn page, there are almost no endorsements for programming/tech, even though I program since age 12 or so. Probably this is an indication that the endorsement system is broken there, or a reflection of a mild problem I have - very few people from my former professional, mostly investment banking, network know that I can code well beyond VBA scripts. The problem is mild or even not a problem at all, because I am not and will not be seeking a job as a full-time programmer while I have something to eat. Instead, I am mostly interested in quantitative finance or startup projects where I could utilize all my knowledge and boost my productive by just delegating work to hardware. These days I think about programming in the same way as I think about math or English language or Excel - it is just an essential tool for achieving goals in some practical domain, not a separate domain (unless you are a language designer or a computer science teacher).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy many aspects of pure programming, such as &lt;del&gt;premature&lt;/del&gt; performance  optimization, but the most fascinating thing about programming for me is augmentation of my human abilities. I cannot add numbers hundred million times per second or crawl the entire web and analyse content of million pages, but I can write a program to do so. A great philosophical question, which requires a separate post, is &amp;ldquo;Who is the actor - an entity that perform the actions encoded in my program - when my program runs&amp;rdquo;. Is it a machine, or a person who started the program, or an author of programming language, or a CPU designer, or is it me? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it a way to expand human consciousness and existence beyond their bodies and lifetimes!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are my answers to some programming background questions from my application to the Hacker School, where I spent three summer months in 2014 and which is now known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.recurse.com/&#34;&gt;Recurse Center&lt;/a&gt;. (I like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.recurse.com/blog/77-hacker-school-is-now-the-recurse-center&#34;&gt;old name&lt;/a&gt; much more!)  By the way, this is a great place for people who are passionate about programming, who are not yet damaged by formal education or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition&#34;&gt;enterprise software practices&lt;/a&gt;, and who prefer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2012/02/zuck-letter/&#34;&gt;the hacker way&lt;/a&gt; of doing things to other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describe your programming background in a few sentences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 12, I was yet to learn about the Turing test and tried to write a chat bot talking to humans. That failure did not push me away from programming. During my high school, I was planning for a CS degree and was accepted to a local tech university already in January 2002. However, in the June the best university in my country invited me to any economics faculty I would choose, without exams. That was a no-brainer, because I liked economics as well. Programming became my main hobby and an important tool for study and work, but it was not my craft. In 2010, I was not happy with the stagnating investments industry and could not ignore the booming tech industry, so I started to invest my time heavily into modern programming. I was fluent in VBA and OK with the LAMP stack and HTML/JavaScript, so I started with Ruby on Rails. Then I touched statically typed C# and realized that I cannot stand for avoidable complexity of dynamic languages. With C#, I started to develop some projects, but it did not work for some tasks. Over the past year, I learned F# to a decent level and now I develop my grown-up projects with .NET stack with a huge bias toward F#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you worked professionally as a programmer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, technically. But my first ever $100 I earned around 2004 from guys in my dorm by writing a search webpage to query a DB with real estate objects and a page with a form to add new objects. Then a colleague from my first real job for several months paid me an additional half of my intern salary from his pocket to develop for him a website about local stock market. Then I used VBA/SQL heavily to build infrastructure for analytics and to do complex calculations while working at other banks, but was paid for investment research, not code. Now I program my own projects and this is my primary activity, but it is not employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not have a CS degree and am not going to seek one because this is impractical now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(answers are as of January 2014)&lt;/p&gt;
